Common rc-like files for my linux environments
----------------------------------------------

Working with lots of different linux environments results in a headache in managing terminals 
which aren't completely alien.

This repostiory brings together all of my various rc files, so I can quickly depoly 
them to new machines that I work with.


What I do
---------

```
git clone git@github.com:pelson/linux_setup.git ~/.setup

cat >> ~/.gitconfig <<EOF
[include]
    path = ~/.setup/gitconfig
EOF


cat >> ~/.bash_profile <<EOF
source ~/.setup/bash_profile
EOF

ln -s ~/.setup/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
